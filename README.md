# Nativefier Icons

Icon Repository for [Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/).

Nativefier will look in this repository for high resolution icons before trying to automatically infer an icon from the target Url.

The [index](http://jiahaog.com/nativefier-icons/) is automatically generated with [GitCloud](https://github.com/jiahaog/gitcloud) using Jekyll.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit a pull request for any `.ico`, `.icns` or `.png` icon!

- `.ico` - For Windows
- `.icns` - For OSX
- `.png` - For Linux

If the icons for the correct platforms are found here, the [optional dependencies](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/#optional-dependencies) for Nativefier might not be required to infer an icon for that particular target web page.

For example, I want to add an `.ico` file to the repository, for [http://www.facebook.com/](http://www.facebook.com/).

A helpful tool for this is [iconverticons.com](https://iconverticons.com/online/)

### Naming Convention

Rename the icon file to `facebook.ico`, just use the key identifier for the page.

### Step 1

Copy the file to `./files`

### Step 2

Add an entry for the file to `./data/gitCloud.yml`

For example, add the following lines to the end of the file.

```yml
- name: facebook
  href: files/facebook.ico
```

### Step 3

You're done! Submit a pull request with the changes and I'll merge them in as soon as possible.

## Work In Progress

- [ ] Proper naming conventions (Suggessions are welcome!)
- [ ] CI tests for pull requests
- [ ] Just use a `.png` and let CI convert the icons to the other formats
